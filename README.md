## About

Sui Sans is a faithful digital recreation of the typography found on vintage Sansui stereo equipment from the 1970s. This font captures the distinctive character of an era when audio equipment was built to last and designed with both function and aesthetic appeal in mind.

The typeface originates from my father's beloved Sansui stereo system, whose clean, geometric letterforms embodied the precision and craftsmanship of Japanese industrial design during the golden age of hi-fi audio.
